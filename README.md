# Twaila
 
A Terraria mod that displays the name, mod, and texture of the tile you are looking at in the world

This mod is greatly inspired by the Minecraft Mod WAILA by ProfMobius and is intended to function in a similar way

[IMPORTANT NOTES]
- This mod is currently in development and is not complete

[Config Options]
- UseItemTextures: Priotizes displaying the texture of the item that places the tile as opposed to the texture of the tile itself (Only works for tiles that have items that place them)

[Controls]
- Toggle UI (Mouse3 by default): Switches the visibility of the UI Panel
