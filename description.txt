Displays the name of the tile you are looking at in the world

This mod is greatly inspired by the Minecraft Mod WAILA by ProfMobius and is intended to function in a similar way

Important Notes:
This mod is currently in development and is in no way complete
Currently only works for a few Vanilla tiles (Modded tiles have not been implemented yet)
